CKPatch (and its sources) are released under the GNU General Public
License, version 2. The file COPYING.TXT contained within this
distribution archive explains the full terms of the license.
Briefly, it states that:

- You are free to distribute this program in its unmodified form to
  anyone you wish at any cost.
- If you modify this program in any way, you may also distribute it
  freely and at any cost providing that you state in the
  documentation what modifications you made to the original copy and
  that you make the source code to your modifications freely available.
- You may not deny anyone access to this original unmodified copy or
  its source code.

Please note that CKPatch comes AS IS with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY,
expressed or implied.  The author of CKPatch cannot be held liable
for any consequential damages caused by the use of this program.
You must use this program at your own risk.

I would like to point out that prior to version 0.9.0, CKPatch was
actually released under public domain, since I did not have any
indication of whether the project was a success or not (CKPatch was
originally intended just to be a proof-of-concept program, nothing
more).  Since I cannot revoke the distribution terms for these
earlier versions once they have been distributed, they will have to
remain in the public domain, and are not affected by the change to
the GPL for version 0.9.0.

However, as a sign of courtesy, I would appreciate it if you would
consider releasing any derived works of any pre-0.9.0 versions of
CKPatch that you may create under the GPL as well.  There is of
course no obligation to do this, but I feel it would be in
everyone's best interests to comply with this request.
